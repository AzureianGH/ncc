# NCC Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get up and running with NCC quickly, assuming no prior knowledge of the compiler.

## What is NCC?

NCC (Nathan's C Compiler) is a compact C compiler that converts C code into assembly language for 8086/DOS systems. It's perfect for retro computing, DOS development, and learning about compilers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (to build NCC itself)
- Make
- NASM (to assemble the output)
- DOSBox or similar (to run the compiled programs)

### Building NCC

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the NCC directory
4. Run `make`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzureianGH/ncc.git
cd ncc
make
```

## Your First NCC Program

### 1. Create a Simple C Program

Create a file named `hello.c` with the following content:

```c
// hello.c
int main() {
    // This will be our first NCC program
    return 42;
}
```

### 2. Compile to Assembly

Use NCC to compile your C code to assembly:

```bash
./bin/ncc hello.c -o hello.asm
```

### 3. Assemble the Program

Use NASM to convert the assembly to an executable:

```bash
nasm -f bin hello.asm -o hello.com
```

### 4. Run the Program

Run your program in DOSBox:

```bash
dosbox hello.com
```

To verify the return code in DOSBox, you can type `echo %ERRORLEVEL%` after your program exits.

## Understanding the Output

Open `hello.asm` in a text editor to see the generated assembly code. You'll see something like:

```asm
; Assembly code generated by NCC
section .text
org 100h  ; COM file format starts at offset 100h

_main:
    ; Function prologue
    push bp
    mov bp, sp
    
    ; Return value in AX
    mov ax, 42
    
    ; Function epilogue
    mov sp, bp
    pop bp
    ret
```

This shows how NCC translates your C code into assembly instructions.

## Next Steps

### Try More Complex Programs

Experiment with more C features:

- Variables and expressions
- Control structures (if, while, for)
- Functions with parameters
- Arrays and pointers
- Structs

### Example: Working with Variables

```c
// variables.c
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}
```

### Example: Control Structures

```c
// control.c
int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    int i = 1;
    
    while (i <= 10) {
        sum = sum + i;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    return sum;  // Returns 55
}
```

### Example: Functions

```c
// functions.c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10);
    return result;  // Returns 15
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Program Crashes

- Check for array bounds errors
- Ensure pointers are properly initialized
- Verify function calls have the correct parameters

### Compilation Errors

- Check syntax against supported C features
- Ensure all variables are declared before use
- Verify types are compatible in assignments

### Runtime Errors

- Check for division by zero
- Verify memory access is within bounds
- Check return values from functions
